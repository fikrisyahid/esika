E-learning app made with Next JS.
Currently only support 1 subject, that is english.

This app was made for fun and to apply what I've learn so far (code readibility, modularize, DRY, etc).

> Notes: the content of .env is safe to be distributed, the true secret lies in the vercel env configuration
